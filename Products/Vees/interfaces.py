Assumptions are assumed to be true without having a proof. It is impossible

to do anything in our world without building on assumptions. Most

assumptions cannot be tested due to a lack of time (or resources). Thus

we all have to risk making bad assumptions if we want to do anything. In

research bad assumptions can substantially change what your result mean.

That is why it is important for you to be aware of the assumptions you

make and to develop an intuition about their quality.

1. The list of assumptions that you make while observing and interpreting

your data is much longer than you can list here. Focus on the most

important assumptions that may affect the conclusions you can draw from

your observations.

2. Check the simplifying assumptions that you make to help you to save

time when observing and analyzing your data. These can render your

results worthless if they cannot be properly justified. Think about how the

conclusions change if a certain assumption is wrong.

3. Examples for such assumptions include (i) assuming the absence of

biases in your data even though you know there are some biases, (ii)

assuming that all important aspects of the system have actually been

observed, (iii) if you sort observations into categories you assume that these

categories are appropriate, (iv) many more.

idea are you testing? Write it down.

2. Decide what analysis, transformation or statistic best shows the

difference (or similarity) you want to highlight. Find appropriate

representations like graphs, tables, categorizations, statistics etc that

highlight patterns in the data you want to demonstrate for documenting

your claim. Then try to prove the opposite from your data to see if you

have a solid claim or whether the data is inconclusive.

been generated if the most boring alternative explanation answering your

question was true.

analyses close to the data. Leave all interpretations for later sections.
